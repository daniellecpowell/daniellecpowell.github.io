		<p>Welcome to my site, I’m Danielle, your new Kansas City Photographer. I was born in NYC and raised in LA, Miami, and Chicago. Big wild cities are all fun, but I’m very happy to call KC my home now.</p>
		<p>Anyway, you’re not here to read about the tale of the three cities. You’re here to find yourself a professional Kansas City photographer. You know that you want a portrait session. That’s the first step. You want amazingly awesome photos that you can share, post on social media, and maybe print out. You want photos you can look back on years from now and remember the wonderful memories. And you know that in order to get those professional portraits, you need to hire a professional Kansas City photographer. Professional. Someone who interacts with you in a professional manner AND someone who delivers professional looking photos. Not from a point and shoot camera phone that your neighborhood toddler can take while sitting down in his diaper—side note, it’s gotten to that point where I wouldn’t be surprised if a baby even knew how to take photos with a phone. Anyway, you are looking for a photographer that services the Kansas City area, one who can tell you how to pose, one who can recommend a great location with a beautiful view, one who knows what they are doing. Oh, and most importantly one that will actually show up the day of your shoot!</p>
